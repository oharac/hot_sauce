Both the Scotch Bonnet Fuyu Sauce (red sauce, leaf label, very spicy) and Anaheim Tomatillo Sauce (green sauce, flower label, very mild) sauces were made by fermenting home grown chili peppers with other ingredients.  Peppers and other vegetable ingredients were chopped finely and mashed with salt (3% by weight), allowed to ferment for two weeks, then stabilized with vinegar and additional spices.  Additional fermentation may occur slowly – keep refrigerated for best flavor.  Both sauces are vegan and gluten free, but made on home kitchen equipment.

The Scotch Bonnet Fuyu sauce starts with home grown Scotch Bonnet and habanero peppers, which are between 100,000 and 350,000 Scoville Heat Units (SHU - for reference, jalapenos are about 5,000 SHU).  After blending with other ingredients (including home grown fuyu persimmons from a friend's tree), I expect this sauce is probably around 50,000-75,000 SHU.  This is about 15-20 times hotter than Tabasco^TM^.  If you're a fan of the [Hot Ones YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAzrgbu8gEMIIK3r4Se1dOZWSZzUSadfZ), this would put it around #6 in the lineup.

The Anaheim Tomatillo sauce includes mild Anaheim chili peppers (between 500 and 1000 SHU; mine were very mild, on the low side) mellowed with roasted tomatillos, onion, and garlic, along the lines of a salsa verde.  This sauce is probably around 100 SHU, a little zestier than a bell pepper, but tangy with vinegar and warm spices.
