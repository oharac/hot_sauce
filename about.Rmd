Both the Scotch Bonnet Fuyu Sauce and Anaheim Tomatillo Sauce were made by fermenting home grown chili peppers with other select ingredients.  Peppers and other vegetable ingredients were chopped finely and mashed with salt (3% by weight), allowed to ferment for two weeks, then stabilized with vinegar and additional spices.  Additional fermentation may occur slowly – keep refrigerated for best flavor, though they'll be fine for your flight home (make sure the cap is on tight!).

The Scotch Bonnet Fuyu sauce starts with home-grown Scotch Bonnet and habanero peppers, which are between 100,000 and 350,000 [Scoville Heat Units](https://www.chilipeppermadness.com/frequently-asked-questions/the-scoville-scale/){target='_blank'} (SHU - for reference, jalapenos are 3,000 to 5,000 SHU).  After blending with other ingredients (including home grown fuyu persimmons from a friend's tree), I expect this sauce is probably around 50,000-75,000 SHU.  This is about 15-20 times hotter than Tabasco^TM^ (about 3,500 SHU).  If you're a fan of the [Hot Ones YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAzrgbu8gEMIIK3r4Se1dOZWSZzUSadfZ){target='_blank'}, this would put it around #6 in the lineup.

The Anaheim Tomatillo sauce includes home-grown mild Anaheim chili peppers (between 500 and 1000 SHU; my crop was very mild, on the low side) mellowed with roasted tomatillos, onion, and garlic, along the lines of a salsa verde.  This sauce is probably less than 100 SHU, a little zestier than a bell pepper, but tangy with vinegar and warm spices.

Home grown chili peppers were grown with only organic fertilizers and pesticides.  Most other vegetables are also organic.  Both sauces are vegan and gluten free, but made on home kitchen equipment.

Try these sauces on eggs, tacos, pasta, burgers, pizza, whatever you like!  I like to pour some of the spicy stuff into an avocado half and eat it with a spoon – the avocado really mellows the heat!
